This application was written because the existing camera classification tools available were inadequate.

It is written in open source tools and uses open data. It is based on QGIS for ease of development.
QGIS already has good prototyping tools as well as having python Qt5 GUI widgets for improved interfaces.
The intention is to store the source code on GitHub and submit it to be ratified as an official QGIS plugin.

The latest plugin is now called CoraxClassifier.zip. This includes the help, image loader and the plugin for QGIS.
