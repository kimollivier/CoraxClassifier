This application was written because the existing camera classification tools available were inadequate.

It is written in open source tools and uses open data. It is based on QGIS for ease of development.
QGIS already has good prototyping tools as well as having QT5 development for improved interfaces.
The intention is to store the source code on GitHub and submit it to be ratified as an official QGIS plugin.
